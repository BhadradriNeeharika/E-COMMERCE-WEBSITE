🛍️ Shop Sphere – Technical Architecture Document
1. Overview

Shop Sphere is a MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) based e-commerce website that allows users to explore products, view detailed information, add items to a shopping cart, and manage checkout operations.
The goal is to build a clean, responsive, and efficient application that supports real-time interactions and seamless data flow between frontend and backend systems.

2. Objectives

Create a responsive UI for product browsing and cart management.

Implement a secure backend API for handling product, user, and cart operations.

Maintain data consistency with MongoDB Atlas.

Provide smooth navigation using React Router and state management using Context API or Redux.

3. System Architecture
🧩 Architecture Type:

Three-tier Architecture (Client → Server → Database)

Frontend (Client Layer)

Technology: React.js / Next.js

Responsibilities:

Display product listings, details, and cart contents.

Handle routing using React Router.

Manage application state (cart, user session) using Context API / Redux.

Send REST API requests to backend via Axios or Fetch.

Backend (Application Layer)

Technology: Node.js with Express.js

Responsibilities:

Expose RESTful API endpoints.

Handle CRUD operations for products, users, and cart.

Communicate with MongoDB Atlas.

Manage authentication, validation, and routing.

Database (Data Layer)

Technology: MongoDB Atlas (cloud-hosted database)

Responsibilities:

Store user information, product data, and cart details.

Maintain collections like:

users

products

cart

orders

5. Modules and Components
Module	Description	Key Technologies
Product Module	Displays product list and details.	React.js, Express.js, MongoDB
Cart Module	Manages add/remove/view cart items.	React Context / Redux
User Module	Handles registration, login, authentication.	JWT, bcrypt, Express.js
Order Module	Simulates checkout and order confirmation.	Node.js, MongoDB
6. API Endpoints
Method	Endpoint	Description
GET	/api/products	Fetch all products
GET	/api/products/:id	Get details of a product
POST	/api/cart	Add product to cart
GET	/api/cart	View user cart
DELETE	/api/cart/:id	Remove product from cart
7. State Management

Option 1: React Context API for lightweight state sharing.

Option 2: Redux Toolkit for structured global state.

Stored States:

Cart items

Product details

Authentication token

8. Security and Deployment

Security: JWT authentication, password hashing (bcrypt).

Deployment:

Frontend: Vercel / Netlify

Backend: Render / Railway

Database: MongoDB Atlas

9. Tools & Dependencies
